1. Setting Up the Project Structure:

Create a new React project for the frontend.
Set up an Express.js server for the backend.
Use MongoDB as the database.
2. Frontend (React.js):

Landing Page:
Display a welcome message and a brief description of the platform.
Register Page:
Form with fields like name, email, password, and phone number.
Validate the form inputs before sending them to the backend.

Validate and send a reset link/code to the provided email/phone.
Dashboard Page:
Fetch user details from the backend and display them in a table view.
Include options to edit or delete user details.
3. Backend (Express.js):

User Routes:
/api/register: Handle user registration.
/api/login: Handle user login and authentication using JWT.
/api/forgot-password: Handle forgot password requests.
/api/reset-password: Handle password reset requests.
/api/dashboard: Fetch user details for the dashboard.
Database Integration:
Connect Express.js with MongoDB using Mongoose.
Create user schema and model for storing user information.
Implement CRUD operations for user management.
4. Database (MongoDB):

Set up MongoDB database to store user information.
Create a collection for users and store user details such as name, email, password hash, phone number, etc.
5. Additional Features:

Implement token-based authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure login.
Use bcryptjs to hash passwords before storing them in the database.
Add error handling and validation for input fields on both frontend and backend.
Include proper UI/UX design for a seamless user experience.
Project Workflow:

User lands on the landing page and can navigate to the registration or login page.
After registration, the user can log in using their credentials.
If a user forgets their password, they can request a reset link/code via email or phone.
Upon successful login, the user is redirected to the dashboard where they can view and manage user details.
Implement session management or JWT expiration to ensure user security.
This project provides a basic structure for user management with authentication, password reset functionality, and a simple dashboard to display user details. You can further enhance and customize it based on your requirements and preferences.
